## Testing

Testing should ensure code works without any warnings whatsoever and passes regression tests.

- [GitHub Actions?](https://www.incredibuild.com/blog/using-github-actions-with-your-c-project)
  - [example](https://github.com/kirshamir/GitHubActionsExample)


## Packaging

Useful to consider:
- Straight git cloning as a submodule or otherwise
- [Arduino library registry](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry)
  - [Some forum where it was discussed](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/uploading-a-library-to-the-library-manager-from-a-github-branch/1162648)
